# FIXME: check_update.sh results in images only being published when there are
# apk package updates but we ALSO need publish when files within a build
# context have changed
#   ↳ Compare hash of current build vs what's on ghcr.io + existing check_update.sh logic
#   ↳ Maybe something like `git diff --name-only <from> <to>` + get SHA hash of
#     last master commit with successful publish + hash of current commit

# TODO: Tag images with something deterministic (SHA1 hash?) + latest
