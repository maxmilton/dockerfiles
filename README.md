# Max's Dockerfiles

üêã Monorepo with all my personal docker images.

## Overview

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Image | Badges | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| chromium | x | Ephemeral Chromium browser for ad-hoc use. |
| firefox | x | Ephemeral Firefox browser for ad-hoc use. |
| gcloud | x | Google Cloud SDK CLI tool. |
| net-block | x | Transparent network proxy with ad-blocking capabilities. |

There are more images I only use for specific use cases in the `.extra` directory. These don't get built by default with the Makefile nor do they get tested in the CI workflow.

## How to use

### Prebuilt images

Images are publicly available on [GitHub packages](https://github.com/MaxMilton?tab=packages).

### Build locally

> Tip: Use the `REGISTRY` env var to set the name prefix, e.g. `REGISTRY=local` would result in an image named `local/chromium`.

Make all images:

```sh
REGISTRY=local make all
```

Make a specific image:

```sh
REGISTRY=local make chromium
```
